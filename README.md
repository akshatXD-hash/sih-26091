# Kaarva (कारवाँ) — AI-Driven Hyper-Local Business Advisory & Financial Structuring Platform

> **Smart India Hackathon 2026 — Problem Statement SIH-26091**  
> **Ministry:** Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MoSJE)  
> **Domain / Track:** Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development / Software  
> *“Empowering Rural Micro-Entrepreneurs: AI Advises. Rules Decide. Credit Delivers.”*

Kaarva is an AI-driven, hyper-local business advisory and financial structuring platform purpose-built for rural micro-entrepreneurs, artisans, and marginalized beneficiaries under the aegis of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MoSJE).

Addressing the core challenge of **SIH-26091**, the platform replaces anecdotal decision-making with institutional-grade data consulting:
1. **Hyper-Local Market Advisory (`/advisory`)**: Evaluates village- and block-level market demand, APMC Mandi price benchmarks, saturation capacity, and seasonal cash-flow risks.
2. **Personalized Financial Structuring (`/structuring`)**: Intelligently structures project costs into promoter equity (as low as 5%), MoSJE back-ended capital subsidies (up to 35% under NSFDC, NBCFDC, NSKFDC, NDFDC, PM Vishwakarma, and PMEGP), and debt portions.
3. **Cash-Flow Aligned Rural Amortization**: Eliminates debt stress by offering repayment schedules aligned with agricultural harvest cycles (Kharif/Rabi) or weekly village haats, with up to 6 months setup moratorium.
4. **Deterministic Scheme & Bank Matching (`/schemes`, `/branches`)**: 100% explainable rule evaluation backed by 21,000+ geo-located bank branches with audited scheme support.
5. **Voice-First & Gram Udyog Mitr Assistance (`/asha-worker`)**: Multilingual voice auto-fill (Groq Whisper) in 11+ Indian languages and an audited field worker workspace for digitally illiterate rural beneficiaries.

```

1. **AI Assists, Rules Decide**: AI models extract structured intents from natural language/audio, simplify complex policy jargon, and perform OCR on certificates. AI **never** makes approval decisions, changes ranking scores, or overrides deterministic scheme eligibility rules.
2. **Human in the Loop**: All AI-extracted fields (profile info, OCR income/caste details) require explicit user confirmation before becoming part of the active application.
3. **Auditability & Traceability**: Every status change, note, document verification, and branch scheme confirmation is attributed to a verified user with timestamped event logging.

## Key Features

### 1. Multilingual Voice & Conversational Assistant
- **Voice-to-Form Auto-Fill** (`/api/voice/auto-fill`): Speak in Hindi, Marathi, English, or other regional languages to automatically populate eligibility forms. Powered by **Groq Whisper Large v3 Turbo** with local fallback and silence hallucination suppression.
- **Supported Languages**: Hindi (`hi`), Marathi (`mr`), Bengali (`bn`), Tamil (`ta`), Telugu (`te`), Gujarati (`gu`), Kannada (`kn`), Malayalam (`ml`), Punjabi (`pa`), Urdu (`ur`), and English (`en`).
- **AI Scheme Assistant** (`/assistant`): Bounded conversational assistant that answers queries regarding loan policies, subsidy mechanisms, and repayment terms without logging personally identifiable information (PII).
- **Policy Term Simplification**: Jargon simplifier transforms bureaucratic policy terms into plain language in English or Hindi.

### 2. Explainable Rule Matching & Scheme Discovery
- **Deterministic Matcher** (`src/lib/matching.ts`): Evaluates applicant profiles against active loan schemes using structured criteria (turnover, project category, annual income, age, gender concessions, trade, collateral requirements).
- **Transparent "Why?" Breakdown**: For every scheme, applicants can expand a detailed audit trail showing exactly which rules passed, which failed, and what information is still missing.
- **Zero Hallucination Guarantee**: If an applicant requests an amount outside limits or has exceeding income, the reason is clearly cited alongside official source documentation.

### 3. Geospatial Branch Locator & Directory Intelligence
- **PostGIS Spatial Radius Queries** (`src/lib/branches.ts`, `src/lib/bank-directory.ts`): Spatial `ST_DWithin` calculations against India-wide OpenStreetMap bank nodes (21,000+ branches) and GeoNames postal data (162,000+ places).
- **Composite Branch Ranking** (`src/lib/branch-ranking.ts`): Ranks branches considering straight-line distance, available fund quota, and NPA (Non-Performing Asset) health metrics.
- **Branch Scheme Support Auditing** (`/admin/branch-support`): Verified officers record scheme-level branch confirmations backed by HTTPS evidence URLs, valid for 90 days.
- **Smart Rural & Alias Fallbacks**: Supports Hubballi–Dharwad twin-city handling, Bengaluru/Bangalore aliases, postal code multi-village disambiguation, and automated 100 km radius expansions for rural areas.

### 4. Dynamic Action Plan & Skill Readiness
- **Live Checklist** (`src/lib/action-plan.ts`): Computes preparation milestones dynamically from applicant profile requirements, chosen schemes, and document states.
- **Interactive Competency Exercises**: Tailored modules for business applications (unit costing, cash record keeping, local marketing) and education applications (study budgeting, academic evidence organization).
- **Reversible Practice Progress**: Learning readiness does not gate submission or simulate approval scores, ensuring equal opportunity.

### 5. Financial Modeling & Provisional Pre-Sanction PDF
- **EMI & Moratorium Calculator** (`src/lib/finance.ts`): Calculates monthly installments, moratorium grace period capitalization, total payable amounts, and gender-based interest rate concessions (e.g., 0.5% – 1% female interest rebates).
- **Provisional Pre-Sanction Letter Generation** (`src/lib/pre-sanction-pdf.ts`): Server-side PDF generation using `pdf-lib` detailing applicant details, chosen scheme terms, estimated EMI, and clear non-approval provisional disclaimers.

### 6. Secure Document Uploads & OCR Evidence Extraction
- **Zero Client-Secret Exposure**: Files are validated server-side (size cap 5MB, strict MIME inspection: PDF, PNG, JPEG, WebP) and uploaded to Cloudinary in authenticated delivery mode.
- **Supported Document Types**: `AADHAAR`, `PAN`, `CASTE_CERTIFICATE`, `ADDRESS_PROOF`, `INCOME_PROOF`, `BANK_STATEMENT`, `PROJECT_REPORT`, `EDUCATION_CERTIFICATE`, `ADMISSION_LETTER`, `FEE_STRUCTURE`, and `OTHER`.
- **Time-Limited Signed URLs**: Documents are downloaded via transient, 5-minute authenticated signed URLs.
- **OCR Verification Pipeline**: Income and caste certificates can be processed through the AI OCR engine, with side-by-side officer review.

### 7. Administrative Officer Dashboard & Audit State Machine
- **Role-Based Access Control** (`ADMIN`, `CHANNEL_PARTNER`, `REVIEWER`, `APPLICANT`).
- **Application Lifecycle**: Enforces valid state transitions:
  $$\text{DRAFT} \longrightarrow \text{EXTRACTION\_PENDING} \longrightarrow \text{EXTRACTION\_COMPLETE} \longrightarrow \text{SUBMITTED} \longrightarrow \text{UNDER\_REVIEW} \longrightarrow \begin{cases} \text{APPROVED} \longrightarrow \text{DISBURSED} \\ \text{REJECTED} \\ \text{WITHDRAWN} \end{cases}$$
- **Officer Tools**: Lead filtering, internal review notes, document verification toggles, and AI service health monitor.

## Database Models & PostGIS Integration

The database is built on PostgreSQL with the **PostGIS extension** enabled.

### Key Models
- **`User`**: System accounts with roles (`APPLICANT`, `ADMIN`, `CHANNEL_PARTNER`, `REVIEWER`).
- **`LoanScheme`**: Public credit schemes with structured criteria (income thresholds, age brackets, gender incentives, required documents, interest bounds).
- **`ChannelPartner`**: Lending institutions with fund quotas, NPA rates, and spatial `location` points.
- **`BankDirectory`**: 21,000+ public OSM bank branch points with spatial GiST indexing.
- **`SearchPlace`**: 162,000+ Indian postal localities and cities with GIN alias indexing and Trigram search.
- **`Application`**: Citizen loan application containing deterministic profile state, AI extraction metadata, and lifecycle status.
- **`DocumentUpload`**: Authenticated Cloudinary document references, OCR outputs, and verification status.
- **`BranchSchemeSupport`**: Audited officer confirmations linking specific branches to supported schemes.
- **`ApplicationTask` & `ApplicantCompetency`**: Dynamic readiness checklists and self-reported skill practice milestones.

### Spatial Setup
Prisma represents `channel_partners.location` and `bank_directory.location` as `Unsupported("geography(Point, 4326)")`. The initial migration enables PostGIS before creating these tables and adds spatial GiST indexes. Queries use parameterized raw SQL for high-performance radius searches.

## AI & ML Service Integration

The application interfaces with an external AI service or runs fully self-contained using a rich local mock:

| Operation | Method / Endpoint | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Health Check** | `GET /health` | Validates AI service availability and version. |
| **Intent Extraction** | `POST /extract-intent` | Extracts structured loan parameters from freeform text or voice transcripts. |
| **Term Simplification** | `POST /simplify-term` | Explains policy jargon in plain English or Hindi. |
| **Recommendation Explanation**| `POST /explain-recommendation` | Generates comparative notes between eligible schemes. |
| **Scheme Assistant** | `POST /chat` | Multilingual, bounded conversational Q&A without storing PII. |
| **Document OCR** | `POST /ocr/document` | Extracts structured income, name, and certificate IDs from images. |

Set `AI_SERVICE_MODE="mock"` for offline testing or `AI_SERVICE_MODE="remote"` to target the live FastAPI backend.

---

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory modeled after `.env.example`:

| Variable | Purpose & Guidance |
| :--- | :--- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Pooled connection string from Neon (contains `-pooler` in hostname). |
| `DIRECT_URL` | Direct connection string from Neon for Prisma CLI migrations and seeding. |
| `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL` | Optional separate Neon branch URL for creating dev migrations. |
| `AI_SERVICE_MODE` | `mock` for offline local development; `remote` for live FastAPI service. |
| `AI_SERVICE_URL`, `AIML_SERVICE_URL` | URL of the deployed FastAPI service (e.g. `https://sih-26-ai-ml.onrender.com`). |
| `AI_SERVICE_TIMEOUT_MS` | Timeout for AI service requests (defaults to `30000` ms). |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Groq Speech-to-Text API Key for Whisper Large v3 Turbo transcription. |
| `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` | Exact **Cloud name** shown in Cloudinary dashboard (not project name). |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` | Server-only Cloudinary credentials for authenticated document storage. |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | Generated authentication secret (generate with `npx auth secret`). |
| `AUTH_TRUST_HOST` | Set to `true` when behind a trusted deployment proxy. |
| `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Optional 12+ character officer credentials created by `npm run db:seed`. |

---

## Getting Started & Local Setup

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Use Node.js **22.12+** in the 22.x series, or Node.js **24+**, with npm.
- **PostgreSQL**: With `postgis` extension enabled (configured for Neon).
- **Package Manager**: `npm` (v10+)

### 2. Installation & Secrets
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/akshatXD-hash/sih-2026-website.git
cd sih-2026-website
npm ci
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
```bash
# In POSIX shells (Linux / macOS):
cp .env.example .env

# In PowerShell (Windows):
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Generate your `AUTH_SECRET`:
```bash
npx auth secret
```

Replace the database connection strings in `.env` with your Neon pooled and direct credentials.

### 3. Database Migration & Seeding
Apply committed migrations and seed initial schemes, sample partners, and the optional officer account:
```bash
npm run db:generate
npm run db:deploy
npm run db:seed
```

> **Tip**: To access the protected officer dashboard (`/admin`), set `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (12+ characters) in `.env` before running `npm run db:seed`.

### 4. Import Location Directory (Optional for Full Offline Spatial Search)
Download and import OpenStreetMap banks and GeoNames India locations:
```powershell
# In PowerShell / pwsh:
powershell -File scripts/download-location-data.ps1
npm run db:locations
```

### 5. Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

---

## Testing & Quality Assurance

Kaarva includes an automated test suite with **175+ tests across 25 test suites** covering matching logic, ranking equations, financial calculations, authentication guards, and voice processing.

```bash
# Run all unit and mock-mode tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate a sample pre-sanction PDF artifact
npm run pdf:sample

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Validate production build
npm run build
```

### Optional Database Integration Tests
To run live database integration tests against your configured database:
```powershell
# Action Plan DB Integration Test
$env:TEST_ACTION_PLAN_DATABASE = '1'
npx vitest run src/__tests__/action-plan.integration.test.ts

# Location & Bank Directory Spatial Test
$env:TEST_LOCATION_DATABASE = '1'
npx vitest run src/__tests__/location-directory.integration.test.ts
```

---

## Security & Boundary Guarantees

1. **Defense-in-Depth Authorization**: Route protection in `src/proxy.ts` provides optimistic navigation redirects, while **every Server Action and Route Handler independently verifies user identity and ownership**.
2. **Server-Only Asset Delivery**: Cloudinary API secrets and storage keys are strictly isolated in server runtimes. Files are accessed via transient, signed URLs with 5-minute expirations.
3. **Database Security**: Direct and pooled connection strings mandate `sslmode=verify-full&channel_binding=require` to verify certificates and SCRAM channel binding.
4. **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs, file uploads, and AI responses are strictly validated through Zod schemas before persistence.
